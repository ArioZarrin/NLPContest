We gave three packs of data to participants. The first one, which we published on 17/05/2017, contained all the related messages to candidates for the recent election in Telegram public channels. This packet contained more than 1.4 million messages, as having fresh data was important given the live challenges candidates were facing in the last days leading up to the election. We asked teams to continue their coding until we published new data. Every day, Telemine crawlers gathered new data, and NetMine published it to the participants. The last packet of data we published was on 19/05/2017, which included all the data from the day before the election.

In each folder, there are four subfolders, with "key1" being the most important and containing the most relevant messages.
